# nba-rank

 Our project is based on the current popularity of NBA players on the subreddit, www.reddit.com/r/nba.
We acquired player data from nba.com, including player names and their respective team. Using this data, 
we analyzed the top 100 posts from the last week on r/nba, checking every post and comment to see if any 
current player was mentioned. In addition to keeping a running count of all mentions, we deemed the polarity
of every comment, weighed highly upvoted comments more heavily, and aggregated those measures into a final score, 
representing how positively or negatively the player is perceived on the subreddit at this time.
